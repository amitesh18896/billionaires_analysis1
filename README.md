Billionaires Analysis with Python

The dataset that I am using to analyze the data about billionaires around the world was curated by Forbes and is downloaded from Kaggle.
The dataset contains information about global billionaires in 2021,
including their:

Names
Net Worth 
Country 
Source 
Rank
Age
Industry


Summary


So this is how you can find patterns among billionaires around the world to analyze 
the business environment of countries.
The success of a business or startup depends a lot on the business environment of a country.
At the end of the analysis of global billionaires,
I found that China and the United States are the countries with the most billionaires
which concludes that the business environment and the success
rate of a startup is much better in the US and China than in the rest of the world.
